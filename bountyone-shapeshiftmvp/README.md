# Shapeshift API MVP

A project for the bounty posted on BountyOne.

## Set up

Simply download the repo, then run
```
npm install
npm start
```

This should open up a port on localhost for the app to run, and it will most likely also open a webpage for you. If not, it will tell you the port in the terminal, which you can enter into your browser as 'localhost:-port-'
